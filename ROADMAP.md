# 🗺️ Roadmap: SSA AI Helper

## 📌 Version 1.0 – April 13, 2025

This project exists to ensure that all Americans — especially the elderly, disabled, and marginalized — can access their Social Security benefits, even as government staffing and infrastructure deteriorate. We aim to build a reliable, community-powered safety net of AI tools, human support, and actionable data.
